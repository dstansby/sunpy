sunpy currently makes a number of assumptions about missing or incorrect values
stored in files from various sources. Previously it was not always clear what
or when these assumptions were being made. Now any assumptions raise a warning
stating which key is being modified, and the new value it is being set to.

In order to prevent these warnings, missing metadata must be explicitly set
before being loaded by `sunpy.map.Map`.
